TI LM3632 Backlight Driver

Required properties:
  - compatible: "ti,lm3632-backlight"

Optional properties:
  - bl-name: Backlight device name. /sys/class/backlight/##bl-name##.
  - full-strings-used: Define it in case of two LED strings used.

PWM specific optional properties:
  - pwm-period: PWM period value. Define it in case of PWM based control mode.
                If this property is not defined, then brightness control mode is I2C.
  - pwm-max-brightness: Max current value in register 0x04 and 0x05.
                        Range is from 0 to 2047.
  - pwms and pwm-names: Please refer to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pwm/pwm.txt.

Example 1:
Brightness mode is I2C. Two backlight strings are used.
If 'bl-name' is not specified, then the lcd channel name is 'lcd-backlight'
by default. (/sys/class/backlight/lcd-backlight/)

lm3632@11 {
	compatible = "ti,lm3632";
	reg = <0x11>;

	ti,en-gpio = <&gpio0 3 0>;

	backlight {
		compatible = "ti,lm3632-backlight";
		full-strings-used;
	};
};

Example 2:
Backlight mode is PWM. Brightness is controlled by PWM controller, PWM3943.
PWM#0 is port number of PMW3943.
Channel name is 'lcd'. (/sys/class/backlight/lcd/)

lm3632@11 {
	compatible = "ti,lm3632";
	reg = <0x11>;

	ti,en-gpio = <&gpio0 3 0>;

	backlight {
		compatible = "ti,lm3632-backlight";

		bl-name = "lcd";
		full-strings-used;

		pwm-period = <10000>;
		pwm-max-brightness = <1637>; /* 20mA */

		/* PWM controller for lm3632 backlight */
		pwms = <&pwm3943 0 10000>;
		pwm-names = "lm3632-backlight";
	};
};
