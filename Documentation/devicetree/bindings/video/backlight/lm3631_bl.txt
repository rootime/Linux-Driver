TI LM3631 Backlight Driver

Required properties:
  - compatible: "ti,lm3631-backlight"

Optional properties:
  - bl-name: Backlight device name
  - full-strings-used: Define it in case of two LED strings used.
  - mode-pwm-only: PWM input mode
    or mode-comb1: I2C x PWM befoer sloping
    or mode-comb2: Sloped I2C x PWM
    The default mode is the I2C only.
  - initial-brightness: Initial brightness value

PWM specific optional properties:
  - pwm-period: PWM period value. Define it in case of PWM based control mode.
  - pwms and pwm-names: Please refer to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pwm/pwm.txt.


Example 1:
Brightness is I2C only mode. Backlight device name is 'lcd'.

&i2c4 {
	clock-frequency = <400000>;

	lm3631@29 {
		compatible = "ti,lm3631";
		reg = <0x29>;

		/* GPIO134 for HWEN pin */
		ti,en-gpio = <&gpio5 6 0>;

		backlight {
			compatible = "ti,lm3631-backlight";
			bl-name = "lcd";
			full-strings-used;
		};
};

Example 2:
LM3631 brightness is controlled by PWM3943 controller.
PWM3943 is a PWM controller. PWM#1 is port number of PMW3943.

&i2c4 {
	clock-frequency = <400000>;

	lm3631@29 {
		compatible = "ti,lm3631";
		reg = <0x29>;

		/* GPIO134 for HWEN pin */
		ti,en-gpio = <&gpio5 6 0>;

		backlight {
			compatible = "ti,lm3631-backlight";
			bl-name = "lcd";
			full-strings-used;
			mode-pwm-only;

			pwm-period = <10000>;

			pwms = <&pwm3943 1 10000>;
			pwm-names = "lm3631-backlight";
		};
};
